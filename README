Vera++ - Programmable verification and analysis tool for C++

http://www.inspirel.com/vera/

Vera++ is a programmable tool for verification, analysis and transformation of C++ source code.

The simplest way to learn what Vera++ can do is to see the [Vera++ Demo][demo].

Vera++ is a tool designed for programmers - not only in the sense that it helps with everyday development work, but also in the sense that all its rules are implemented as scripts that can be modified or added by the user. Thanks to this, programmers have complete freedom and control over what the tool does and how it works.

Vera++ is mainly an engine that parses C++ source files and presents the result of this parsing to scripts in the form of various collections - the scripts are actually performing the requested tasks.

Vera++ Community Edition provides syntax-oriented view on the source code and is available for free and as open source, distributed under the terms of the [Boost Software License][bsl].

Current version: 1.1.1

Supported platform: g++ ([download source][src], 53kB).

Windows users can also try the binary version, compiled on Windows XP with VC++ 9 ([download binary][bin], 590kB)

See [Vera++ online manual][doc] for more information.

The *Community* part in the name means that everybody is welcome to suggest their own new rules and transformations so that the whole product can be improved.
